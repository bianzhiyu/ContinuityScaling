# ContinuityScaling
Demonstration of applying continuity scaling method on typical models.

## Numerical Simulation 1

From [Exp1LogisticGrp4](https://github.com/bianzhiyu/ContinuityScaling/tree/main/Exp1LogisticGrp4) download two files: 
`ACX.m` and `main_LogisticGrp4.m`, and then 
put them in the same directory on your computer. 

Run `main_LogisticGrp4.m` in MATLAB. 
The scaling curves will be plotted, and the causality strength indexes and p-values will be printed automatically after running.


Note that: the p-values depend on the random numbers generated by the running environment. In typical cases, whether a p-value is less than 5% is concerned.
