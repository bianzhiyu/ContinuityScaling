# ContinuityScaling
Demonstration of applying continuity scaling method on typical models. 
Theses demos establish examples showing that how to apply continuity scaling method to data.

## Numerical Simulation 1

### Model Settings:

Unidirectional ecosystems with various coupling strength.

### Codes:

From [Exp1LogisticGrp4](https://github.com/bianzhiyu/ContinuityScaling/tree/main/Exp1LogisticGrp4) download two files: 
`ACX.m` and `main_LogisticGrp4.m`, and then 
put them in the same directory on your computer. 

Run `main_LogisticGrp4.m` in MATLAB. 
The scaling curves will be plotted, and the causality strength indexes and p-values will be printed automatically after running.

### Notes:

Note that: the p-values depend on the random numbers generated by the running environment. In typical cases, whether a p-value is less than 5% is concerned.


## Numerical Simulation 2

### Model Settings:

Bidirectional ecosystems with various coupling strength.

### Codes:

From [Exp2LogisticGrp4_2D](https://github.com/bianzhiyu/ContinuityScaling/tree/main/Exp2LogisticGrp4_2D) download two files: 
`ACX.m` and `main_LogisticGrp4_2D.m`, and then 
put them in the same directory on your computer. 

Run `main_LogisticGrp4_2D.m` in MATLAB. 
Analogously, the scaling curves will be plotted, and the causality strength indexes and p-values will be printed automatically after running.
